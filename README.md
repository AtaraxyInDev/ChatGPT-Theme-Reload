# Chatgpt-color-theme README

<!--Notas :D-->

Good morning, afternoon or evening, here Ataraxy, I made this theme, for myself because I personally like the colors of the general interface of Chatgpt and I wanted to share it with you because I think it was very nice, no more to add, Enjoy!

## Attention: It is currently more adapted to js than any other language!!!
